# travel-mate-2

Minimal first MVP view for a travel expense app.

## Included

- `index.html`: initial landing page for the MVP.
- `vercel.json`: lightweight Vercel config for clean URL handling.

## Deploy

Deploy to Vercel directly from this repository. The `index.html` file now serves the root route (`/`) to avoid the previous 404 `NOT_FOUND` response.
